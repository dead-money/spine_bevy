//! 3D (`Material`) flavor of the Spine material. Spawned by
//! [`crate::mesh::build_spine_meshes_3d`] for skeletons tagged with
//! [`crate::components::SpineRender3d`]. The fragment math (tint-black over
//! a PMA atlas sample) is identical to the 2D material; the differences
//! are the trait impl, the WGSL imports, and the vertex-stage plumbing.
//!
//! Deliberately unlit: Spine's light/dark color channels already bake
//! authored lighting, and atlas samples are premultiplied by their own
//! alpha. Layering PBR lighting on top would double-count both.
